<details><summary>look around</summary>
You are now standing in front of the elephant monument in the Nelson Mandela Park. Your task is to find the hidden box to solve the riddle the professor gave you.<br></details>
<br>
<details><summary>There is a bench, a trash bin and a strange looking bush near the monument. You also notice a small staircase leading below the base of the monument. The door looks old and rusty, with colonial time decorations and emblems engraved into it.</summary>
  <details><summary>go to bench </summary><br>   
  The bench is covered by moss and bird poop... It hasn’t been used in some time. The paint has almost fallen off. This is not the place professor Kraysee would hide something.<br>
I should probably go back.<br></details>
<details><summary>go to trash bin </summary><br> 
  The trash bin is full of … well... trash. Who would have thought? But wait! A PET bottle! Easy money, if you can stand getting it out with your bare hands…<br>
  <details><summary>pick up bottle</summary>
    Great you got the bottle out! But now you really want to wash your hands...<br>
    <b>You receive a PET bottle</b><br>
    leave </details></details>
  <details><summary>go to strange looking bush </summary><br>   
    Look at this strange/suspicious/odd looking odd bush! Do you want to take a closer look? You want that right?<br>
YES<br>
You are standing in front of the bush. All of a sudden there’s a mother with her child, the child says “Mami mami there's a guy in the bush”.<br>
You look at them and shout: “Hey that’s my bush! Look for your own!!” with some irony in your voice.<br>
The mother pulls her child away and goes further away from you.<br>
Now you have time to inspect the location closely. You notice that there is a hidden object. It almost looks like a box. Could this be the item the professor wanted me to find?<br>
    <details><summary>pick up [box]</summary></details>
    <details> <summary>open [box]<br></summary></details>
  </details>
    <details><summary>go to the door </summary>

<b>L1T2.3</b>
<b>L1T2.3.1</b> The box is secured with tape that contains the words “It’s prime time!” repeated multiple times written all over it. The word <b>prime</b> stands out with a blue colored shape.<br>
<br>
<b>L1T2.4</b> The door is locked by some sort of mechanism. It won’t open. Trying to pry it open is probably not a good idea. It’s a monument after all. Let’s try not to incriminate ourselves just yet, shall we?<br>
Try to open the door<br>
go back<br>
<br>
<b>L1T2.4.1</b> Okay Sherlock, you try to force the door open. It won’t budge.<br>
Good thing nothing broke… atleast you hope so<br>
<br>
<b>L1T3</b> Inside the box, there is a piece of paper with a riddle, an old T9 mobile phone and a GPS device.<br>
<b>Bonkers!</b><br>
<b>You receive a GPS device</b><br>
<br>
Now for the phone. You start it, but you need a 4-digit pin to unlock it. Maybe the piece of paper can help?<br>
<br>
<b>Your task is to solve the riddle.</b><br>
<br>
You pick up the piece of paper inside the box and read it.<br>
Hint: It’s <b>prime</b> time!<br>
<br>
629387445<br>
<br>
That’s a lot of numbers. What does this have to do with the 4-digit code? Maybe there is something special about these numbers.<br>

<br>
<b>L1T4</b> Congrats! You have now solved the riddle and are able to use the mobile phone.<br>
<br>

<b>You receive a message on your mobile phone</b><br>
<br>
Oh! You just received a <b>new message</b>… Impeccable timing.<br>

From: Prof. K.
To: Me (bzw. Player name)

You are wondering why this all happens? It's simple: I want you feel research. Experience what it means to be a historian. Uncover secrets and hidden truths. My hope is that it will inspire and motivate you to do great things, no matter the cost.

Back on track: Have you noticed the elephant statue right in front of you?
No? Okay you just got exmatriculated. Just kidding!

I want you to find out everything about this monument and the time it was built. Don’t hold back, it might become quite the adventure.

Now, head over to the flea market near the Schlachte and look for an ancient artifact. You’ll know what I mean when you see it.

Good luck.

<b>You can change your location by opening the gps device. </b><br>
<br>
open gps <br><br>
<br>
go to/move to: schlachte/flea market <br>
<br>
<b>You are now at the Schlachte flea market.</b><br>
<br>
look around: There are dozens and dozens of little stands with people selling anything you could imagine. From trash to very nice and expensive coats to various paintings.<br>
<br>
<b>You have a closer look at one of the stands and an ancient treasure chest catches your eye. You take the chest to gain a better view. The salesman looks at you.</b>
Optionen: steal the chest, ask for price, put it back.<br>
<br>
steal the chest: You look around for a good way to run off, but the market is way too crowded for you to flee. You decide against stealing the chest.<br>
<br>
Put it back: You try to put the chest back on the table but a magic force stops you from doing it. You really want this chest.<br>
<br>
ask for price: <br>
Player: Yo! How much you want for that ol' wooden box, Mister?<br>
The salesman: 50 bucks.<br>
Player: FIFTY BUCKS?!? _mumbling_ This thing ain't even worth 5 bucks..<br>
The salesman: What was that?<br>
Player: Nothing. <br>
Player: ...<br>
Player: Can we do 20?<br>
The Salesman: Aight. There you have it.<br>
<br>
<b>You receive ancient chest.</b>
<br>
<b>Inside the chest, you find a wooden totem. The moment you have a closer look at the totem, you notice you receive a message on your mobile phone. Ahh, it's Professor Kraysee again!</b><br>

To: Me (bzw. Player name)

Congrats, you found the item.
Oh you found something interesting. Do you mind sending me a picture?


```

<br>
<em>How does he even know I found something? There's something shady about this guy.</em><br>
<br>
<b>You send Prof K. a picture of the ancient chest.</b><br>
<br>

```
From: Prof. K.
To: Me (bzw. Player name)

Thank you Player.
Very cool.

I did some research and I found out that this chest has indeed some kind of connections to the colonialism.
In fact this chest was once in possession of the Atikuku tribe.
The Überseestadtmuseum has an exhibition about the Atikuku's. You should go there and investigate.

<br>

<em>You curse out loud.</em><br>
Enough is enough! I went to the Park, then I went to the flea market at the Schlachte and now you want me to go to the museum?<br>
I'm not your henchman.<br>
...<br>
<em>You think about your bachelor thesis.</em><br>
Ok maybe it really isn't so bad..<br>
I should just do what that Krayzee dude told me.<br>
<br>
<b>You open up your GPS Device:</b><br>
<br>
go to/move to überseestadt(/-museum)<br>
close gps/device<br>
