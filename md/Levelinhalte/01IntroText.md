BREMEN: An extraordinary story about a student and an elephant (in progress)

...you are standing before the closed door.<br>
The nervousness rises with each passing second.<br>
Will this be my last hours as a student of the university of Bremen?...<br>
<b>Professor Kraysee:</b> … I’ve told you, this was your last chance! You already cheated once on your bachelor thesis.<br>
<b>Player:</b> But Professor Kraysee, I really need my degree!<br>
<b>Professor Kraysee:</b> I know that. And I also know that I would ruin your life if I would make you fail. But I need to follow the rules.<br>
<b>Player:</b> … <br>
<em>Player’s eyes getting wet..</em><br>
<b>Professor Kraysee:</b> Alright, look I may have a task for you. I give you a very last chance for your bachelor thesis. I choose the topic and I conduct your research. If you successfully complete what I ask for I will let you pass. This way you will get your degree even though you cheated. But this will be a difficult tasks and I’m not sure whether you will be able to do it or not.<br>
<b>Player:</b> Please please please. I will do anything!<br>
<em>Not literally!</em><br>
<b>Professor Kraysee:</b> Alright, here you have some notes. If you solve this riddle I will give you the chance to start your quest.<br>
<br>
<b>You receive some notes.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Player:</b> Thank you Professor! I will not disappoint you, I promise!<br>
<br>
<em>You walk out of the room.</em><br>
<br>
Yes! We did it! I’m so glad the Professor gave me a second chance! Or should I say third? Well, this doesn’t matter. Actually, let’s take a look at the notes he handed me.<br>
<br>
  
    
      
You take a look at the notes. <br>  

You manage to read the notes, even though your eyes are watery and your Professors handwriting is awful, to say the least.<br>
<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Go to the elephant monument in the Nelson-Mandela-Park,
there you will have to find a hidden box.
Once you found it, you will have to solve a riddle.
If you manage to solve the riddle I will contact you.
Good luck, you will need it.”

- Kraysee

<em>There’s nothing on the back of the paper. But there’s a stain on the bottom of the front page.</em><br>
<em>You taste it.</em><br>
<em>Chocolate.</em><br>
<br>
Ugh. I hate chocolate! Professor Kraysee always eats lots and lots of chocolate, no wonder there are stains on every paper we receive…<br>
<br>
<em>You walk out of the University and make your way to the Nelson-Mandela-Park.</em><br>
