Integration of dialogue into plan-based interactive storytelling
IS = generation of narrative actions and dramatization of these actions

[**Characters in search of an author: ai based virtual storytelling**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45420-9_16)

Purpose: generating a sequence of narrative actions staged through the behavior of virtual actors.
Characters intentions, goals, high level tasks and primitive actions

Narrative formalisms centered around story elements/ events
Plans constitute the description of an artificial actor´s behavior
Using plans to represent role´s, each actor gets a plan associated with its role. Used for story generation.
Generierte Charactere für das Spiel könnten aus mehreren Pläne zusammengesetzt werden. Anhand von den plänen können die Entwickler Input für den gpt-2 entwickeln.
Plan based representation -> behavior generation
Plan content is derived from narrative formalisms

Key problems in interactive storytelling: status of user, level of explicit narrative representation and narrative control, modes of user intervention and relations between characters and plot
Relation between characters and plot
