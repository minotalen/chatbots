### Anmerkungen beim Testverlauf

### Interview-Protokoll

- Sind ihnen Unterschiede in den Gesprächen aufgefallen? Wenn ja, welche? <br>

first thing i noticed is that they do different things when they are bored at home

2nd just kept chatting but rubbish sentences /no sense
1st tried to manipulate the chat to go back to the topic
1st one was obv bot second bot or stroke

real?
the second one felt more real than the first one
first one: robotic 
second one: chaotic (like googletranslator)
introduction was good and the cake one (beginning was good and got worse and worse towards the end)
how many brothers are they twins etc.

- Welcher Chat war Unterhaltsamer? <br>

more symphaty with first one
second was more engaging(maybe) and fun(nier)

the second one i would have chatted longer with 
first one was too limited 

second one was more intriguing

- (Nach erklärung des Projekts) Könntest du dir das so Vorstellen? Welche vor und nachteile fallen dir auf? <br>

second one is fun but too chaotic so in a textadventure i would prefer the first bot and maybe you can add the second one as some sort of special setting
combine both bots that would be very interesting

When I'm bored I tend to waste a lot of time on the internet myself. I have started watching book reviews of very terrible books lately<br>
It is very amusing to see the reviewer slowly lose it's mind actually<br>
