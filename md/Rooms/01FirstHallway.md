After some poking the door gives up and opens. You jump down the stairs. The door at the end opens far smoother than the first one, probably an older one and you're out. Only a few minutes left to get to the GW1 where the exam takes place. You have luck, you got a bus waiting for the right destination. After the ride you are heading to the front of the GW1. Knowing you are on time makes you relieved and you are definitely going to pass the exam." |
