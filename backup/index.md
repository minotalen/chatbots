#### how to edit

All the content lives in the `md` folder- go at it! Multiple people can work on it at the same time!

[here is a quick guide to using markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
If you want a live preview of the rendered text, click on 'show in the top bar', then select 'next to the code'.  
You should now be able to see the document on the right!

[This is how to link to other files](test)  (the file lives in md/test.md)

[you can link to folders](deep/link) (this file lives in deep/link.md)

Edit `views/index.html` to change the outer look and feel of the page. (If anyone wants to apply some .css magic, go for it!)
